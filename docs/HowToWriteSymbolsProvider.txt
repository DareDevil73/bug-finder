Writing a symbol provider can be a hard task, depending of the symbols 
type you need to support.

----------------------------------
1 - Symbol provider implementation
----------------------------------

A symbol provider is a DLL that implements a unique interface 
(ISymbolProvider).

To create a new one you must follow these few steps:

 1) create a DLL project;
 
 2) remove any default unit inclusion;
 
 3) include into the project the following files:
 
    - intf/hSymProvider.pas
    - intf/uSymProvider.pas
   
 4) create a unit for your provider;

 5) extend the class TSymProvider with your own and implement the
    two methods:

    - QuerySymbol
    - QueryAddress

 6) extend the class TSymProviderFactory with your own and implement
    the method "AcceptModule".
    
 7) in the initialization section register the factory by calling
    the method "RegisterFactory".

2 - Symbol provider debugging
-----------------------------    

Simply register it into a custom configuration file using BugFinder.exe
as host application.

That's all! :)
